        <p class="text-muted text-left" >Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It's a historical site famous among tourists.

Maeve, Bronwyn's sister of the Bayview four, finds herself and her friends in a dangerous game of truth or dare- the truth being a secret revealed to the whole school, or an extreme dare. Gossip spreads fast in Bayview high, and there's only one way to stop it- find out who it is. Finding out who it is seems impossible, especially since this secret person knows all the secrets of Bayview, but when you have your friends by your side, what can go wrong? Everything. <br>
